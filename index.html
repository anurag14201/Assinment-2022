        <p>
            After a year and a half of canceled plans, we can all be forgiven for being hesitant to start putting things
            on the calendar again. In some cases, we've even grown accustomed to the simplicity of staying inside our
            own boxes, content to never venture outside of our comfort zone if we can help it. Sadly, these new habits
            have a major downside, and that's all the good things we've unintentionally left behind.
